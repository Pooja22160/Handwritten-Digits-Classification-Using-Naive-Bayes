Handwritten digits classification has been treated as a multi-class classification problem
in the machine learning context, where each of the ten digits (0â€“9) is viewed as a class and
the machine learning task is essentially to train a classifier that can effectively
discriminate the ten classes. Naive Bayes algorithms are a set of supervised machine learning algorithms based on the Bayes
probability theorem. The Bayes theorem describes the probability of a feature, based on prior
knowledge of situations related to that feature. For example, if the probability of someone
having diabetes is related to his or her age, then by using the Bayes theorem, the age can be used 
to more accurately predict the probability of diabetes.
